# Project Proposal: {{Project Name Here}}

You will submit this proposal twice. Once before you begin your project, and once at the end. If things change during development, you must update the proposal for the final submission.

## Project Goals
List out at least four goals for your project. These can include things you'd like to learn, new tools you'd like to try, or skills you're struggling with that you'd like to improve. Do not include a feature list here - these are *your* goals

## Tech Stack

### First Party Tools
- Describe which technologies you are working with and what they will do
- For example, React for building the interface, and Node for communicating data with the React application and storing data in a database
- Describe front end, back end, and database

### Third Party Tools
List any third party services you will be using and *why*. If there are costs assocaited with usage of third party services, include them here.

## Features and Deliverables
What will you be delivering as part of the final project? What sort of features will be available by the final day of class? What features do you plan on doing later on? Are there any features that you would like to add that you are unsure you can complete in time?

## Data
Describe each *thing* you will need to know about. For example, for a store, you need to know about a **Customer** and a **Product** perhaps. Each of these must be described here. 

For each *thing*:

- Describe the object and why you need to know about it. What features does it enable?
- Define how you are going to get the data. Will users provide it? Will we get it from somewhere else? If so, make sure that place is listed under Third Party Tools above.
- Define attributes of the object you need to know (color, price, etc.) and what JavaScript type best represents them. For example:
    - color: `String`
    - price: `Number`
